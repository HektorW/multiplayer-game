# Planning
## Basic setup of project
  - setting up client and server connection
  - rendering primitives
  - local input
  - movements
  - 1D movements

## Delaying techniques
  - delaying from server
  - delaying from client

## Basic state synchronization between a client and server
  - timestamps
  - sending input/positions/movements
  - authorative server

## Client prediction
  - predicting movements in client
  - sending validations from server

## Somewhere here 2D movements
  - keeping it simple up to this point

## Server reconciliation
  - server acknowladging clients movement
  - client validates acknowladgments

## Multiple clients
  - interpolating other clients movement

## Shooting / collisions
  - some sort of shooting / collision handling

## Server collision checking in the past
  - keeping state
  - backtracking on timestamp
